# CS305softwareSecurity


Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their clients. Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. Artemis Financial would like security to be a top priority in the development of their new software.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

The most useful technique to help identify the client's security vulnerabilities in their code was using static testing. The dependency check on Artemis Financial' software application showed the following vulnerabilities: externally-controlled input, bypassing input sanitation controls, vulnerability to XML external entity attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, execution of arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers, entity expansion during a load operation, and potential remote code execution. Software security is upmost importance for any business, let alone a business like Artemis Financial, that secures the finances of a large amount of clients. 


What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The most difficult part working through the vulnerability assessment would be the technical errors that needed to be solved. At times I feel that errors are a great way to learn by having to critically think what may be causing such errors preventing the vulnerability assessment from working. But at times it can be a huge waste of time when hours are spent only to find a spelling or spacing type is the culprit. 


How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I approached the need to increase layers of security by following the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram provided by our provider. With this diagram, I followed a step by step plan on how to approach this project to help fulfill the needs of the client, Artemis Financial. Also, with practice of manually looking over the code, my approach may change. 


How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

After refactoring the code, we ran another vulnerability check to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Once the vulnerability checks cleared, running the code again to make sure it was functional was the final step.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I will definetely keep the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram within arms reach when going over these kinds of tasks. Also the github on dependency checks and OWASP was extremely helpful for all my troubleshooting needs. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

While the technical side of the job is extremely important to employers, I would like to emphasize the strong focus that has been made on focusing on the clients needs. Intepreting these client needs effectively has to be one of the most important steps in these types of projects. This is a skill that can be hard to develop and to find.
